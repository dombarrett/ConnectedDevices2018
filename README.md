# ConnectedDevices2018
This is the repo for my temperature sensor project for Connected Devices, Spring 2018

Package requirements are node-adc1x15, onoff

The physical input script runs the physical UI that was build with an ADC, potentiometer, and three LEDS

The temperature server reads the ADC with the TMP36 connected, and posts to a server
